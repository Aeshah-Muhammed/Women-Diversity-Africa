          <li>To showcase the power of African women,</li>
          <li>To ensure diversity in the workplace,</li>
          <li>
            To help women develop confidence in themselves and their abilities,

          <li>
            To ensure that change happens in the workplace in terms of

            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>
              Women diversity in the workplace is the practice of including and
              involving women from a range of different social and ethnic
              backgrounds in the workplace.
            </p>
            <h4>Problem Definition</h4>
            <p>
              After thorough research, the team understands the challenges
              African women face in the workplace, and how this plays a major
              role in the sustainable development of organizations, and society.
            </p>
            <p>
              These challenges range from gender gaps in organizations, lower
              chances of promotability, gender-based stereotypes, greater
              scrutiny at leadership roles, and many more.
            </p>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
              Women Diversity Africa is a conference that seeks to showcase the
              strength of African women, raise conversations regarding the
